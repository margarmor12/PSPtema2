/* Activity psp.activities.U2A1_Shutdowner
 *
 * Create a new Java application project (package psp.activities & main class U2A1_Shutdowner) Using the command line, ask the user for the action he wants to do with the computer (shutdown ,restart or suspend) and how much time he needs before shutting down the system.
 *
 * Find information about the shutdown command in GNU/Linux and make your app work in both systems.
 * Your app has to prepare the right command for the answers the user has given and for the OS it is running on.
 *
 * Get the ProcessBuilder.command() result and show it on the console in a readable format.
